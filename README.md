# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build and evaluate models capable of accurately identifying fraudulent activities, thereby helping financial institutions and customers mitigate risks associated with unauthorized transactions.

## Key Features
1.Modeling: Three machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, are individually trained and evaluated to detect fraudulent transactions. 2.Ensemble Learning: An ensemble model is constructed using the VotingClassifier technique, which combines predictions from multiple base models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to improve overall performance and robustness. 3.Evaluation: Model performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and classification reports are generated to provide detailed insights into model performance.

## Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for model training and evaluation. scikit-learn: Python library for machine learning tasks including model training and evaluation. Pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis Seaborn: Python library for visualization.
